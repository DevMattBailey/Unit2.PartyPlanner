// Requirements
// For this workshop, you'll be starting from scratch! You are highly encouraged to reference previous solutions. 
// Write JS to build an application that meets the following requirements:
    // index.html is not modified. All elements are generated via JS.


    // When a party name is clicked on, the application updates state by fetching information about a single party from the API.
    // The application renders the name, ID, date, description, and location of the selected party.
    // The application renders a message telling users to select a party if none is selected.
    // Functions are used to organize logic involving state changes.
    // The application is rerendered whenever state changes.
    // UI elements are organized into component functions.
    // All thrown errors are explicitly caught with a try...catch statement.
    // Extensions
    // If you're done early, try to implement one or more of the following features:
    
    // The name of a selected party in the party list is styled differently.
    // The user can also see the guests who have RSVP'd to the selected party. This will involve fetching data from the /rsvps and /guests endpoints! Fetch all the guests first, and then use the RSVPs to filter the guests for the selected party.
        
    // The application updates state by fetching an array of parties from the API.
        
    // The application renders a list of party names.
